# Gun Violenece Archive Database

This is a current ongiong project to collect and display data regarding the gun vioence in each of the US states. This is a passion project that was started and is still being maintained during my free time.

The goal of this project was to visualize gun violence indicents as they are happening in each state. It is easy to view these problems as something that doesnt affect our lives, and being able to see that these incidents are happening frequently in your state is important. Since I had started this project even I was suprised at the fequency that these incidents were occuring. My original idea was to update the database every 3 days, however after a couple days with the script live I realized I would need to increase the frequency. New data is being added daily with most days averaging atleast 4 incidents.

To collect this data I utilized Selenium within a Python environment. My script accesses the website and is then autamated to go through each page and scrape the data. The data is then processed using Beautiful Soup and sent to my SQL server. The server is connected to tableau which is used for data vizualization, the tableau dashboard can be seen below. I have the Python script scheduled to collect data once a day and after that is done the tableau data is updated along with it.

The states shown in the map bvelow are different shades of red depending on the number of incidents that have happened within that state. The number that is displayed on each state is the raw number of  incidents that have occured, where as the color and ranking is per capita.
